# Steps to repeat our experiments

1. Execute `src/UMAP_dr.py` to generate the dimension reduction results.

2. Execute `src/FM_identification.py` to determine the failure mode labels for the training units.

3. Execute `src/exp.py` to obtain the results of the proposed models, benchmark models, and baseline models.
4. Execute `src/result_analysis.py` to produce the figures presented in the paper.
